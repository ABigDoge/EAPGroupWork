# Starter Team Presentation

The starter team presentation is supposed to help you determine your goals in improving your (academic / general) presentation skills in the semester.

## Part 1. Introduction

Good morning everyone. Today we are going to have a speech about how to set proper goals in improving our presentation skills . Effective goal setting could enable us to maximize the progress obtained in a fixed period of time. 

So how can we define a proper goal? Many people think that a specific and measurable goal can help themselves to literally achieve something. It's reasonable that an attainable goal can give you a built-in action plan. If you only describe the big picture, it's likely that you are confused about how to accomplish it, get frustrated and abandon it. However, long-term vision is also critical in goal setting. Identifying the large-scale goals will give you stronger motivation and a clearer prospect. Therefore, only setting small and short-term target will instead set limitation for you.

At the beginning of this semester, we are going to figure out the way of finding the appropriate goal in EAP class, which should be neither too big nor too small. Next, we will explain it in detail from two aspects.
